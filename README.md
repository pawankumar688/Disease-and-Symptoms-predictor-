# Disease and Symptoms predictor:

Fine tune a small language model to identify diseases based on their symptoms involves several steps:

## Fine-Tuning a Small Language Model for Diseases and Symptoms

### Step 1: Data Preparation
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of diseases and their symptoms from reliable medical sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data by:
   - Removing irrelevant information and special characters.
   - Tokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.
   - Normalizing text by converting it to lowercase and removing stopwords.
   - Applying lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
   - Encoding the text data using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

### Step 2: Model Selection
Select a pre-trained language model suitable for fine-tuning, such as:
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
- **DistilBERT (a smaller, faster version of BERT)**

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Set Up Environment:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries and tools, such as Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
2. **Load Pre-trained Model:** Load the chosen pre-trained language model.
3. **Prepare Data for Fine-Tuning:** Convert the preprocessed text data into the format required by the model (e.g., tokenized and encoded sequences).
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Train the model on your specific dataset. Use techniques like:
   - **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Adjust the learning rate during training for better convergence.
   - **Regularization:** Apply dropout or other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Monitor performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the fine-tuned model using a separate validation set. Assess the model's performance with relevant metrics and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

### Step 5: Model Deployment
Deploy the fine-tuned model in a production environment where it can make real-time predictions. Ensure the deployment platform supports scalability and low latency.

### Step 6: Continuous Improvement
Regularly update the model with new data and feedback to maintain and improve its accuracy. Retrain the model periodically to incorporate the latest medical knowledge and user feedback.

By fine-tuning a pre-trained language model with a specific dataset of diseases and their symptoms, you can create an effective tool for predicting diseases based on symptoms, which can aid in early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

I'm under graduat in IT, I'm doing it from sindh agriculture university form pakistan,
I'm very intersted in the filled of AI and it's subfilleds Machine Learninig, deep learning this project is my first project shows that what I have learned this few days, though it's not good as intermediate or master level even I can't compare it to other's and I'm stll learning, You may find some mistakes in my project and I Will be happy if you inform me about them but I'm still in leaning stage, And I will improve.
